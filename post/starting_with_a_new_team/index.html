My previous team was dispersed after the recent layoffs. So here I&rsquo;ll be starting from scratch, with new team members, a new manager, new technologies, new high level goals - but with the same org within the same company.</p><p>This won&rsquo;t be the first team I&rsquo;ll be joining. During my career, I&rsquo;ve been able to identify some habits which help me ramp-up with a new team. I&rsquo;d like to share those here.</p><h2 id=let-go-of-your-ego>Let go of your ego</h2><p>One of the best tips I got from <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajitbanerjee/>Ajit</a>, (a past tech-lead of mine) is this: &lsquo;Be shameless about your lack of knowledge&rsquo;. Even if I have so-and-so years of experience, I&rsquo;m still the noob on the team. I don&rsquo;t have context about what&rsquo;s going on with the team, why things have been built or decided the way they did - so it would be foolish of me to lay down my agenda before learning first and getting my hands dirty with the team&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Asking questions helps build trust with the other team members. When asking questions, clarifications, justifications for why and how things have been shaped into today&rsquo;s reality - you&rsquo;re implicitly telling those people that their time, opinions and experience matters to you. That is the cherry-on-top getting the information you&rsquo;ll need when starting with the new team.</p><h2 id=respect-the-past-but-question-the-present>Respect the past, but question the present</h2><p>Saying something like: &ldquo;Is X really built using Y? That&rsquo;s stupid&rdquo; is a horrible idea. If you haven&rsquo;t been to the team, you don&rsquo;t have context on why things have been built the way they did. It&rsquo;s fine to ask why things are the way they are - but do so respectfully. Maybe there was a hard-deadline. Maybe there was someone on the team who was aggressively pushing to some area and then left? Maybe a thousand other reasons.</p><p>But, as the new team member, you have the unique perspective of coming in with a fresh look onto the team. People who have been to the team for some time may be accustomed to inefficiencies, broken processes and sub-optimal systems - just because both have been there for a long time. It&rsquo;s fine to question those. You might get a good-enough justification for your question, and you might not. You might decide that you want to replace a certain component - and you might fail doing so - but by trying - you&rsquo;ll gain some experience with why things are built the way they are.</p><h2 id=use-bfs-and-dfs-approaches-to-talk-to-people>Use BFS and DFS approaches to talk to people</h2><p>I remember reading similar versions of this suggested by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bosworth>Andrew Bosworth</a> as well as in the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineers-Path-Individual-Contributors/dp/1098118731>The Staff Engineer&rsquo;s Path</a>. When you get to a new team, identify people you should talk to. Ask them who else you should talk to, and follow that graph. At some point, you&rsquo;ll encounter some back-edges, which is good. Traverse the graph in whatever approach you&rsquo;d like. It&rsquo;ll help you identify the key actors in the org, important (recurring) good and bad ideas, etc.</p><h2 id=maintain-a-glossary>Maintain a glossary</h2><p><img src=glossary.png alt></p><p>During the first few weeks/months with a new team - I come across way too many terms and acronyms which I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve built the habit of maintaining a glossary of terms and acronyms of the new team. Specifically, I use <a href=https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/>nvAlt</a> which is a simple but fast note-taking MacOS app. Its search is super-quick and helps getting written information back quickly.</p><p>During meetings I write things I don&rsquo;t understand in my glossary. Unless this is a 1:1 meeting, I don&rsquo;t want to stop the meeting multiple times asking questions. After the meeting, I grab someone from the team, saying something like: &ldquo;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t understand some of the terms during the meeting. Can you please help me clarify those?&rdquo;. Then, I fill out the meaning of the missing terms. Now I have those terms available for me for the next time I&rsquo;ll encounter those.</p><h2 id=join-the-oncall-rotation-asap-to-experience-reality>Join the oncall rotation ASAP to experience reality</h2><p>Without any exception, every time I joined an oncall rotation with all the rotations I&rsquo;ve joined - I felt that I was under-qualified joining. I did the team training, shadowed someone, reverse-shadowed by someone - but still, I felt under-prepared. During my first oncall shift on the L7 load-balancing team, I&rsquo;ve experienced one of <del>Facebook</del>Meta&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/call-cops-when-facebook-is-down-2014-8>hardest outage</a>. I was definitely not ready to handle that one - but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot handling it with the team.</p><p>Designing, building, testing and maintaining a piece of code in a void is one thing. Supporting it in production is a totally different thing. As the saying goes:</p><blockquote><p>You write your code differently when you know it can wake you up in the middle of the night.</p></blockquote><p>By joining the oncall rotation and supporting production you learn about weak areas of your product, improvement areas - and the people who help you when there are issues. All those are very valuable.</p><h2 id=rewrite-the-ramp-up-plan>Rewrite the ramp-up plan</h2><p>As the most-recent-new-person on the team, you have the best view on what&rsquo;s missing from the team&rsquo;s current ramp-up program. When ramping up - keep in mind that you can suggest changes to the program. It&rsquo;ll help your credibility with the team, as well as making the ramp up of the next person easier.</p></div><footer class=entry__footer><div class=entry__tags><a class="entry__tag btn" href=https://www.noamlerner.com/tags/culture/>culture</a></div><div class="entry__share share"><a class="share__link btn" title="Share on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.noamlerner.com%2fpost%2fstarting_with_a_new_team%2f" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Share on Facebook","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="share__icon" aria-label="Facebook" role="img" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M330 512V322h64l9-74h-73v-47c0-22 6-36 37-36h39V99c-7-1-30-3-57-3-57 0-95 34-95 98v54h-64v74h64v190z"/></svg></a><a class="share__link btn" title="Share on LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.noamlerner.com%2fpost%2fstarting_with_a_new_team%2f&title=Starting%20with%20a%20new%20team" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Share on LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="share__icon" aria-label="LinkedIn" role="img" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><circle cx="142" cy="138" r="37"/><path stroke-width="66" d="M244 194v198M142 194v198"/><path d="M276 282c0-20 13-40 36-40 24 0 33 18 33 45v105h66V279c0-61-32-89-76-89-34 0-51 19-59 32"/></svg></a></div></footer></article></div></main><div class="related block"><h3 class=related__title>Related</h3><ul class=related__list><li class=related__item><a class=related__link href=https://www.noamlerner.com/post/be_nice/>Be nice, especially when you don't want to be</a></li><li class=related__item><a class=related__link href=https://www.noamlerner.com/post/the_bus_factor/>The bus factor, during the pandemic</a></li><li class=related__item><a class=related__link href=https://www.noamlerner.com/post/handling_low_tide/>Handling the low tide</a></li></ul></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=bugok/blog issue-term=pathname label=utterances theme=github-dark-orange crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer__social social"><a class=social__link target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.facebook.com/bugok><svg class="social__icon" aria-label="Facebook" role="img" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M330 512V322h64l9-74h-73v-47c0-22 6-36 37-36h39V99c-7-1-30-3-57-3-57 0-95 34-95 98v54h-64v74h64v190z"/></svg></a><a class=social__link target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://linkedin.com/in/noamler><svg class="social__icon" aria-label="LinkedIn" role="img" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><circle cx="142" cy="138" r="37"/><path stroke-width="66" d="M244 194v198M142 194v198"/><path d="M276 282c0-20 13-40 36-40 24 0 33 18 33 45v105h66V279c0-61-32-89-76-89-34 0-51 19-59 32"/></svg></a><a class=social__link target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/bugok><svg class="social__icon" aria-label="Github" role="img" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M335 499c14 0 12 17 12 17H165s-2-17 12-17c13 0 16-6 16-12l-1-50c-71 16-86-28-86-28-12-30-28-37-28-37-24-16 1-16 1-16 26 2 40 26 40 26 22 39 59 28 74 22 2-17 9-28 16-35-57-6-116-28-116-126 0-28 10-51 26-69-3-6-11-32 3-67 0 0 21-7 70 26 42-12 86-12 128 0 49-33 70-26 70-26 14 35 6 61 3 67 16 18 26 41 26 69 0 98-60 120-117 126 10 8 18 24 18 48l-1 70c0 6 3 12 16 12z"/></svg></a></div><div class=footer__copyright>© 2023 Noam Lerner's Blog. <span class=footer__copyright-credits>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vimux/binario rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Binario</a> theme.</span></div></footer><script src=https://www.noamlerner.com/js/menu.js></script>

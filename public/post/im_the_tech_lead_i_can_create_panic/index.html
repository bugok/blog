				<h1 class="entry__title">I&#39;m the tech lead, I can create panic</h1>
				<div class="entry__content"><p>This post is the first real post I had in mind when thinking to start the blog. Is started with a random conversation with a friend who&rsquo;s a tech lead at a big company. We met by chance one morning, and we discussed how different the working environment has become since the pandemic started, and how &lsquo;work&rsquo; has changed in many aspects when everyone, or some, are working remotely.</p>
<h3 id="building-connections-and-trust-when-working-remotely">Building connections and trust when working remotely</h3>
<p>Building connections and trust between team members has become harder since the pandemic started. Before, it was common to get on a plane, visit the other part of your team (or a partner-team) and nail down a piece of a project. Even more importantly, it was possible to have a chat about personal stuff, have a coffee, a beer or some other beverage - and build a human connection with other people. For me, this has changed to the worse, no matter how many &lsquo;virtual coffee&rsquo; sessions I joined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more apparent when you look at people who joined before and after the pandemic started. People who &lsquo;know that person&rsquo; on the other end have it much easier to convey ideas - because they have already built that trust.</p>
<h3 id="escalation">Escalation</h3>
<p>When there&rsquo;s an issue which requires attention, it&rsquo;s helpful to have the right people on-board. But when everyone is working from home, turning off notification to let them focus, it becomes harder to convey the sense of urgency over virtual mediums. Also, you definitely don&rsquo;t want to be the person who cries &lsquo;wolf&rsquo; if there&rsquo;s no reason to do so.</p>
<h3 id="creating-panic">Creating panic</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s when my friend said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the tech lead. I can create panic&rsquo;. She meant that she had built the trust within the team - so if she says something is important - people perceive it as such. It&rsquo;s easier for her to rally up people if she decides to do so. I was also thinking about this in the context of a double-edge sword, or like the Spiderman quote: &ldquo;With great power, comes great responsibility&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think my friend meant that in a way that she likes to stir up panic for the fun of it. She meant that she&rsquo;s got enough credibility within the team to do so. As such, I believe that she knows not to misuse the trust she earned.</p>

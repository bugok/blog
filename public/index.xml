      <description>The definition of the bus factor from wikipedia says:
 The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, derived from the phrase &amp;ldquo;in case they get hit by a bus&amp;rdquo;.
 When thinking about the team structure, having a SPOF (Single Point Of Failure) as a single person - isn&amp;rsquo;t something desirable. &amp;ldquo;What if X gets hit by a bus?</description>

      <description>There are times where you have no other choice but to take your foot off the gas, and still be at work. You&amp;rsquo;re not taking time off, but you can&amp;rsquo;t do the work you usually do. Examples for reasons which can cause these are: code freeze, a holiday season or a shift in direction.
Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t like to be in this situations. I like sitting at my desk knowing what&amp;rsquo;s the next thing I need to tackle.</description>

      <description>This post is the first real post I had in mind when thinking to start the blog. Is started with a random conversation with a friend who&amp;rsquo;s a tech lead at a big company. We met by chance one morning, and we discussed how different the working environment has become since the pandemic started, and how &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; has changed in many aspects when everyone, or some, are working remotely.
Building connections and trust when working remotely Building connections and trust between team members has become harder since the pandemic started.</description>

      <title>Setting up a blog using Hugo and Github pages</title>

      <description>In this first post, in an inception-like manner, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I got this blog to work.
Starting point This started with a Facebook group post which asked what is a good platform to host a blog. There were a few answers, but the hugo and github pages caught my eye, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.
I Googled a bit and found this guide. That was a good starting point, as it allowed me to get something to work - but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully happy with the end result.</description>

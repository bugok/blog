## What's the use case?

Kid got a new phone, you want to factory-reset the old one before you do something else with it. But when an Android device has Family Link supervision enabled, the option to factory-reset the device is blocked with an "action not allowed" error.

## Don't stop supervision

One of the ways to do this is to stop the supervision on the child's Google account altogether. For me, this isn't what I want to do as I do want to keep supervising my kid's other Android devices.

## Steps needed to factory-reset an Android device

### Log-out from the child's account on the device

When logged in to your child's account in a browser, go to [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/). Security -> your devices -> pick the required device -> click on 'sign out'.

### Remove the child's account from the device

On the device, remove your child's account from the device. See instructions [here](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7664951).

### Remove the 'Family Link parental controls' app

Now that the device isn't managed by Family Link, you can remove [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylinkhelper&hl=en).

### Factory-reset

Your Android device can now be reset to its factory settings.

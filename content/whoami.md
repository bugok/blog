Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Noam. 

**Work** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamler/), [github](https://github.com/bugok)):

I like to work on high-scale production environments. I like to debug issues, understand why things aren't working and fix them.
I currently work as a Production Engineer at ~~Facebook~~ [Meta](https://www.meta.com). In the past I worked for [Verint](https://www.verint.com/).

I have a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science and a M.Sc. in Computer Science, both from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/).

**Personal**:

- I'm married with three kids, and live in suburb of Tel Aviv, Israel.
- In the past I learnt photography for two years at [Gavra Studio](https://studiogavra.co.il/). I still enjoy picking up a good camera and taking photos. 
- I used to play table tennis, but now I mostly play [Eleven Table Tennis](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElevenTableTennis).
- I train with [freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/). I'm not very good at it, but I enjoy it very much.
